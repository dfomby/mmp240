            <p>INVINCIBLE is an adult animated superhero series that revolves around 17-year-old  Mark Grayson, who’s just like every other guy his age — except his father is the most powerful superhero on the planet, Omni-Man. But as  Mark develops powers of his own, he discovers his father’s legacy may not be as heroic as it seems.</p>
